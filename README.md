# Gameboy Development Learning

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Gameboy development. Here, I will document my progress, share resources, and showcase my projects.

## Why I Started This Learning Journey


I started this Gameboy development learning journey out of nostalgia. In the eighties, I used to write z80 assembler for the MSX as a hobby. Recently, I acquired a second-hand Gameboy, reigniting my interest in this programming niche.


## Getting Started

To get started with Gameboy development on MacOS, I recommend following these steps:

1. Install RGBDS: RGBDS is a popular assembler and linker for Gameboy development. You can find installation instructions [here](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/install/macos/).

2. Set up an Emulator: Emulicious is a Gameboy emulator that provides a convenient debugging experience. Install Emulicious and its [VS Code debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emulicious.emulicious-debugger) for a seamless integration with VS Code.

3. IDE Setup: I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE and installed the [rgbds Z80](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donaldhays.rgbds-z80) extension for syntax highlighting and other helpful features.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources to enhance your learning journey:

- [RGBDS Documentation](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/blob/master/README.md): The official documentation for RGBDS provides detailed information on how to use the assembler and linker effectively.

- [Gameboy Development Community](https://gbdev.io/): Join the vibrant Gameboy development community to connect with fellow developers, ask questions, and find inspiration for your projects. I've started with the tutorial to get a feel for how the Gameboy works.
